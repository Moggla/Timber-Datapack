This is a really useful addition for those who don't want to spend expensive time on gathering resources! After installing, the Timber Datapack allows you to instantly chop down a tree just by breaking one log with any axe.  
By default, sneaking while breaking will not chop the tree.  
Optionally, you can adjust everything as you wish.  

# Under the Hood Features
- Chops only treesÂ¹
- Works with every type of logÂ²
- Supports custom treesÂ³
- Leaves drop normal loot
- Takes account of any enchantment
- Many options for customization

Â¹ Trees are defined as logs that are next to naturally generated leaves.  
Â² Logs in the tag #minecraft:logs.  
Â³ All kind of custom trees like from **BiomesO'Plenty**, **The Biome Overhaul**, **Terrestria and Traverse**.
